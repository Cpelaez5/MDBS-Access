      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>Subscription(s)</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A.) Ongoing Subscription. Your ES Army Subscription, which may start with a free trial, will continue week-to-week, month-to-month, year-to-year, quarterly, or semi-annually and will renew on every renewal period depending on the subscription option you choose unless and until you cancel, or we terminate, your Subscription. You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") to use the ES Army Subscription service. We will bill the monthly Subscription fee to your Payment Method. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews each payment term (monthly, quarterly, yearly or as stated in product term) in order to avoid billing of the next Subscription renewal fees to your Payment Method.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">B.) Differing Subscriptions. We may offer a number of Subscription plans, including special promotional plans or Subscriptions with differing conditions and limitations. Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Use will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Subscription with ES Army by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link. Some promotional Subscriptions are offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered Subscription plans.</p>

      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4" start="2">
        <li>Free Trials</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A.) Your ES Army Subscription may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your Subscription may last for one week, one month, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. Free trials are for new and/or specified per former members only. Emunah Strength, LLC reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">B.) We will begin billing your Payment Method for Subscription fees at the end of the free trial period of your Subscription unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. For Subscriptions with no free trial, you will be billed immediately upon submitting your order. We may authorize your Payment Method through various methods, including authorizing it up to the price of service as soon as you register. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during your free trial period.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">C.) You will not receive a notice from us advising your free trial period has ended or the paying portion of your Subscription has begun. Email <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:support@erinandsarit.com">support@erinandsarit.com</a> for CANCELLATION INSTRUCTIONS. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on the agreed and accepted basis for your Subscription fee for your Subscription plan until you cancel.</p>

      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4" start="3">
        <li>Billing</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A.) Recurring Billing. By starting your ES Army Subscription and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a Subscription fee at the then current rate on a recurring basis based on chosen renewal period, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the ES Army service to your Payment Method. You acknowledge the amount billed each renewal period may vary for reasons including differing amounts due to promotional offers, gift card redemption, promotional code redemption, and/or changing or adding a plan. You authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed based on chosen renewal plan.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">B.) Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">C.) Billing Cycle. The Subscription fee for our service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your Subscription and each month, 1-month, 12-months, or other chosen period thereafter unless and until you cancel your Subscription. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month, 1-month, 12-months, or other chosen period on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying Subscription. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your ES Army Subscription or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Subscription. Visit our website and click on the "View billing details" link on the "Your Account" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of Subscription or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly refers to your billing cycle.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">D.) No Refunds for Subscriptions. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">E.) Payment Methods. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">F.) Cancellation. You may cancel your ES Army Subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the ES Army service through the end of your monthly billing period. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-TERM SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS OR UNWATCHED MOVIES OR TV SHOW S. To cancel, go to the "Your Account" page on our website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your Subscription, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click "View billing details" on the "Your Account" page. If you signed up for ES Army using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, and wish to cancel your ES Army Subscription at any time, including during your free trial, you may need to do so through such third party, including by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from, the ES Army service through that third party. You may also find billing information about your ES Army Subscription by visiting your account with the applicable third party.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">24. Updates.</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We may modify these TOU at any time, as we deem appropriate.
